this PoC is based on the Intel's sample code. to run it go to the project directory:

1. make clean && make
2. ./app /path/to/tableA.csv size_of_tableA columnA_to_join /path/to/tableB.csv size_of_tableB columnB_to_join

I was running it on Big Data Benchmark data. my command looked for example like that:

./app ../rankings_1node.csv 50000 1 ../uservisits_1node.csv 200000 2
