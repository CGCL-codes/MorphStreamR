# MorphStream

![Java CI with Maven](https://github.com/ShuhaoZhangTony/TStream/workflows/Java%20CI%20with%20Maven/badge.svg?branch=master)

This project aims at building scalable transactional stream processing engine on modern hardware. MorphStream is built based on our previous work of TStream but with significant changes: the codebase are exclusive.
