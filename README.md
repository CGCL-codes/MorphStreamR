# MorphStreamDR

- "R" stands for fast durability and recovery (R)
- "D" stands for distributed (D) transactional stream processing engine

This project aims at 
(i) design fast durability and recovery mechanism for MorphStream,
(ii)building a distributed (D) transactional (T) stream processing engine with CXL-enabled reliable storage backend.
Compute Express Link (CXL) which is an industry-supported cache-coherent interconnect for processors, memory expansion and
accelerators. CXL enables cacheable load/store (ld/st) accesses to memory on Intel, AMD, and ARM processors at nanosecond-
scale latency. CXL access via loads/stores is a game changer to design systems with pooling and sharing memory.
