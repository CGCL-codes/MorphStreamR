# MorphStream

![Java CI with Maven](https://github.com/ShuhaoZhangTony/TStream/workflows/Java%20CI%20with%20Maven/badge.svg?branch=master)

- This project aims at building scalable transactional stream processing engine on modern hardware. 
- MorphStream is built based on our previous work of TStream but with significant changes: the codebase are exclusive. 
- Please checkout our ![wiki](https://github.com/intellistream/MorphStream/wiki) for more detailed desciptions.
