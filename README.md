![Java CI with Maven](https://github.com/intellistream/MorphStream/workflows/Java%20CI%20with%20Maven/badge.svg?branch=master)

- This project aims at building a scalable transactional stream processing engine on modern hardware. It allows ACID transactions to be run directly on streaming data. It shares similar project vision with Flink [StreamingLedger](https://www.ververica.com/hubfs/Ververica/Docs/%5B2018-08%5D-dA-Streaming-Ledger-whitepaper.pdf) from Data Artisans , but MorphStream emphsizes more on improving system performance leveraging modern multicore processors.
